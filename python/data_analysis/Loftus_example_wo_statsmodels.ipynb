They wanted to find out whether the wording of a question affected the later responses of witnesses. To do this she showed subjects a film of a car accident. Following the film, she asked them a series of questions. Among the questions was one of 5 versions of a critical question concerning the speed the vehicles were travelling in miles per hour.
